## Overview

This repository includes Java applications and modules covering a wide range of programming concepts. These projects are designed to help understand Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, algorithms, and other advanced topics.

## Features

- Demonstrates key Java programming concepts
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) examples
- Various algorithms and data structure implementations
- Modular code for reusability and scalability
- Extensive use of Java standard libraries
- File handling and exception management

## Technologies

The following technologies and tools are used in this project:

- **Java 8 or higher**: Primary programming language
- **Maven**: For dependency management (optional, if used in the project)
- **JUnit**: For unit testing Java code
- **Git**: Version control

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   └── resources/
│   ├── test/
│   │   └── java/
├── lib/
├── docs/
├── README.md
└── pom.xml (if using Maven)
```

- `src/main/java/`: Contains the main Java source code
- `src/test/java/`: Contains unit test cases
- `lib/`: Includes external libraries if any
- `docs/`: Documentation for the project
- `pom.xml`: Maven configuration file (if applicable)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- **Java 8 or higher**: [Download here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- **Maven** (if using): [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- **IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans): Recommended for development

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mrshelby0/Java-Project-.git
cd Java-Project-
```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Build the project using your IDE or Maven (if applicable):

```bash
mvn clean install
```

## Usage

Run the project through your IDE or using the command line:

```bash
# For a simple Java program:
javac Main.java
java Main

# If using Maven:
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.Main"
```

You can explore individual modules in the `src` folder, which contain specific examples and implementations of different Java concepts.
